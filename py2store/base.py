"""
Base classes for making stores.
In the language of the collections.abc module, a store is a MutableMapping that is configured to work with a specific
representation of keys, serialization of objects (python values), and persistence of the serialized data.

That is, stores offer the same interface as a dict, but where the actual implementation of writes, reads, and listing
are configurable.

Consider the following example. You're store is meant to store waveforms as wav files on a remote server.
Say waveforms are represented in python as a tuple (wf, sr), where wf is a list of numbers and sr is the sample
rate, an int). The __setitem__ method will specify how to store bytes on a remote server, but you'll need to specify
how to SERIALIZE (wf, sr) to the bytes that constitute that wav file: _data_of_obj specifies that.
You might also want to read those wav files back into a python (wf, sr) tuple. The __getitem__ method will get
you those bytes from the server, but the store will need to know how to DESERIALIZE those bytes back into a python
object: _obj_of_data specifies that

Further, say you're storing these .wav files in /some/folder/on/the/server/, but you don't want the store to use
these as the keys. For one, it's annoying to type and harder to read. But more importantly, it's an irrelevant
implementation detail that shouldn't be exposed. THe _id_of_key and _key_of_id pair are what allow you to
add this key interface layer.

These key converters object serialization methods default to the identity (i.e. they return the input as is).
This means that you don't have to implement these as all, and can choose to implement these concerns within
the storage methods themselves.

    Note that KvPersister is a MutableMapping, and as such, is dict-like.
    But that doesn't mean it's a dict.

    For instance, consider the following code:
    ```
        s = SomeKvPersister()
        s['a']['b'] = 3

    If `s` is a dict, this would have the effect of adding a ('b', 3) item under 'a'.

    - fail, because the `s['a']` doesn't support sub-scripting (doesn't have a `__getitem__`)
    - or, worse, will pass silently but not actually persist the write as expected (e.g. LocalFileStore)

    Another example: `s.popitem()` will pop a `(k, v)` pair off of the `s` store.
    That is, retrieve the `v` for `k`, delete the entry for `k`, and return a `(k, v)`.
    Note that unlike modern dicts which will return the last item that was stored
     -- that is, LIFO (last-in, first-out) order -- for KvPersisters,
